# MSP430 Sensor Interface

This embedded C project is developed using an MSP430FR2355 development board. The software monitors temperature readings provided by an NTC thermistor connected in a resistive bridge with a 1kÎ© resistor, powered by a 3.3V supply. The temperature is read through the ADC module (Pin P1.1 - A1, ADC Channel 1) with a resolution of 10 bits.

## Key Features

- **Temperature Monitoring:** The temperature is calculated using the ADC values and converted to a readable format using a formula.
- **Threshold Comparison:** The measured temperature is compared against a threshold value, which can be modified using buttons connected to pins P2.3 and P4.1.
- **Periodic ADC Readings:** ADC readings are triggered periodically using Timer B0 as a clock signal.
- **I2C Interface:** The temperature and threshold values are displayed on an LCD screen via an I2C connection.
- **Visual and Audible Alerts:**
  - A **buzzer** is activated when the temperature exceeds the threshold.
  - **LED Indicators:** A green LED indicates the temperature is below the threshold, and a red LED indicates the temperature exceeds the threshold.
- **UART Communication:**
  - The temperature data can be transmitted via UART.
  - The threshold value can be increased or decreased using UART TX commands ("<" and ">", ASCII 60 and 62).
